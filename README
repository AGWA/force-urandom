**** THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED ****

As of Linux 5.19, /dev/random is just as good as /dev/urandom, so it
is generally no longer necessary to force programs to use /dev/urandom.

If you do need to force programs to use /dev/urandom for some reason, you
can use ldpreload-forceurandom.so from <https://github.com/AGWA/ldpreload>.


Original README below:

force-urandom is a tool to force programs to use /dev/urandom instead of
/dev/random, since /dev/urandom on Linux is secure whereas /dev/random
is stupidly slow: https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/

Just put force-urandom in front of the command you want to run.
For example, to generate a GPG key in a reasonable amount of time,
you could run:

	force-urandom gpg --gen-key

force-urandom works by LD_PRELOADing a shared library which intercepts
open calls and replaces a /dev/random argument with /dev/urandom.

To compile, run `make`.
